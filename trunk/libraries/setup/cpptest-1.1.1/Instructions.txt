	d) Set the appropriate Runtime Library for each configuration.
	   - You can choose which configuration to edit from the drop-down box at the top.
	   - For Release, the appropriate Runtime Library is Multi-threaded DLL.

Notes:

* The provided .sln file is for an older version of Visual Studio and will need to be converted if you open it in a newer version. This (trivial) process is handled automatically by a Visual Studio wizard (just follow the on-screen instructions).
