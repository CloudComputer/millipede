GDCM 1.2.5 Setup Instructions
Last Updated by Stuart Golodetz on 27/10/09
-------------------------------------------

1. Create a gdcm-1.2.5 subdirectory in the libraries directory.

2. Extract gdcm-1.2.5.tar.gz into the gdcm-1.2.5 directory.

	On Windows:

	a) Just extract it using something like the shareware version of WinRAR.

	On Linux:

	a) Change to the libraries/gdcm-1.2.5 directory.
	b) Run "tar xzf ../setup/gdcm-1.2.5/gdcm-1.2.5.tar.gz".

3. Rename the new gdcm-1.2.5 subdirectory of gdcm-1.2.5 to 'source'.

4. Configure GDCM using CMake and then build it.

	On Windows:

	a) Use the CMake GUI. Set the source and bin directories to those in the gdcm-1.2.5 directory. The install directory (i.e. CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX) should be set to a sibling of source and bin called 'install'. Then just keep changing the options and configuring until you can generate a Visual Studio solution. In particular, if this is the first time you're building GDCM, I recommend:

BUILD_TESTING		OFF
GDCM_BUILD_EXAMPLES	OFF
GDCM_BUILD_SHARED_LIBS	OFF

	b) The created solution (GDCM.sln) will be in the bin directory. Open it, and build the ALL_BUILD project.

	On Linux:

	a) Make a subdirectory of gdcm-1.2.5 called bin (this will be a sibling of the source directory) and change to it.
	b) Run "ccmake ../source" and set the options as per the instructions for Windows above.
	c) Run "make".
