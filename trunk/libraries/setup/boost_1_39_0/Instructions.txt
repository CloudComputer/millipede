Boost 1.39.0 Setup Instructions
Last Updated by Stuart Golodetz on 17/07/09
-------------------------------------------

1. Extract boost_1_39_0.tar.gz into the libraries directory.

On Windows:

a) Just extract it using something like the shareware version of WinRAR.

On Linux:

a) Change to the libraries directory.
b) Run "tar xzf setup/boost_1_39_0.tar.gz".

2. If you only need the header-only Boost libraries, that's it! Otherwise, you'll need to use bjam. The original instructions for doing this can be found here:

http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_39_0/more/getting_started/index.html

(If they're no longer there by this point, the Getting Started instructions for the latest version of Boost will hopefully suffice. Search for it on the main page at www.boost.org.)

Note: The compiled libraries can take up a LOT of disk space (several Gb) - make sure you have enough available first.
