1 Intro (as per stud conf paper)

2 Aim: to illustrate a simple recursive solution to the segmentation problem

3 Approaches

 3A Conventionally - it is "very imperative"

 construct MST and consume it from any side

 include refs

 high-level description of waterfall (space permitting)

 3B FP approach

 single recursive pass (fairly opaque but no special cases for the detail)


4 How it works

 MST (only briefly)

 Eliding edges - cases 1 to x

5 Correctness?

(note that there is arbitrary choice about edges of same weight)


6 Results

7 Conclusions

 - can be done in pure FP style
 - clearer to write/code
 - shorter code and simpler data structures
